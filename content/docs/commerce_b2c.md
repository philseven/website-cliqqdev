## API Calls

### Authentication

#### Authentication/ Create Access Token

Authentication to the API is done via OAuth2.0. Each client application, this includes the POS (via 7-Connect), CLiQQ kiosks, CLiQQ app, and admin system will be given its own client id and client secret to be stored securely inside the application.

```
POST https://<server path>/accounts/oauth2/token

URL Parameters

client_id = {client id}
client_secret = {client secret}
response_type = "token"
grant_type = "client_credentials"

Response
{
  "refresh_token":"788b771fed934aa5cac0da2b2e0c17cf",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "access_token":"Ym9ic2Vzc2lvbjE6czNjcmV0",
  "expires_in":7200
}
```

#### Refresh Access Token

Access Tokens expire for security purposes. To get a new access token, you will need to use the refresh token. As discussed above, access token comes with a refresh token and an expires_in value(time expressed in seconds). The API expects the client to use this expires_in value to track if the access token it is holding is already expired. Send an HTTP POST request to /oauth2/token path to get a refresh token.

```

URL Parameters

client_id = {client id}
client_secret = {client secret}
