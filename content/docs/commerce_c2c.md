## API Calls

### Authentication

#### Authentication/ Create Access Token

Authentication to the API is done via OAuth2.0. Each client application, this includes the POS (via 7-Connect), CLiQQ kiosks, CLiQQ app, and admin system will be given its own client id and client secret to be stored securely inside the application.

```
POST https://<server path>/accounts/oauth2/token

URL Parameters

client_id = {client id}
client_secret = {client secret}
response_type = "token"
grant_type = "client_credentials"

Response
{
  "refresh_token":"788b771fed934aa5cac0da2b2e0c17cf",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "access_token":"Ym9ic2Vzc2lvbjE6czNjcmV0",
  "expires_in":7200
}
```

#### Refresh Access Token

Access Tokens expire for security purposes. To get a new access token, you will need to use the refresh token. As discussed above, access token comes with a refresh token and an expires_in value(time expressed in seconds). The API expects the client to use this expires_in value to track if the access token it is holding is already expired. Send an HTTP POST request to /oauth2/token path to get a refresh token.

```
POST https://<server path>/accounts/oauth2/token

URL Parameters

client_id = {client id}
client_secret = {client secret}
refresh_token = {refresh_token}
response_type = "token"

### Compute Shipping Fee

This will be used to compute the shipping fee. The fee wil be based on the matrix setup between the seller's chosen drop off island group (Luzon/ Visayas/ Mindanao) and the buyer's chosen pick up location.

Upon dropoff, the shipment fee is recalculated based on actual dropoff location. If the shipment fee does not match the original shipment fee, then transaction is declined.
