### Use Case

A customer wants to pay for purchases at 7-Eleven using a mobile app. A barcode is generated by the app and presented to the cashier at the counter for payment. This barcode, together with the amount due will be sent by the POS to the E-Money issuer's host for processing. If accepted, the issuer will deduct the balance and return success so payment checkout is completed.

### Technical Notes

* Barcode must be numeric and rendered in Code-128-C format with a maximum of 22 characters
* Barcode format is `92` + `[partnerID(2)]` + `[mobileNumber(12)]` + `[token(6)]` where:
  * 92: code for the POS to recognize a payment barcode
  * partnerID: code assigned to the issuer
  * mobileNumber: E.164 without the + prefix (e.g. 639xxxxxxxxx)
  * token: is a 6 digit short-lived time-based token to ensure the barcode is only valid within a limited time window
* Device screen brightness must be set to maximum for best scanner readability.
* The barcode will be transmitted to your host server for processing.
* API must respond within 8 seconds or be timed out. See API for more details on exception handling.
