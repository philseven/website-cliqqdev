### Use Case

A customer wants to pay for purchases at the 7-Eleven store using a mobile app. A barcode is generated by the app and presented to the cashier at the counter for payment. This barcode, together with the amount due will be sent by the POS to the E-Money issuer's host for processing. If accepted, the issuer will deduct the balance and return success so payment checkout is completed.

### Technical Notes

* Barcode must be numeric and rendered in Code-128 format with a maximum of 20 characters
* Device screen brightness must be set to maximum for scanner readability.
* API must respond within 8 seconds or be timed out. See API for more details on exception handling.
