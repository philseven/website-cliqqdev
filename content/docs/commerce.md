### Use Case

1. You have an e-commerce site and you want to provide the customer with the option to pay and pickup the order at the nearest 7-Eleven.

2. You operate a marketplace and you want to provide the seller the option to drop off at the nearest 7-Eleven and the buyer to pay and pickup at their nearest 7-Eleven.

### Store List

7-Eleven opens an average of 1 store per day and may schedule temporary store closures for renovation. We recommend using one of the following methods to get the most current listing.

A. Download the current list of stores at the following URL. The update frequency of this csv file is at 06:00 daily. Use this to populate your own store selector.

[http://s3.philseven.com/public/ecms_stores.csv](http://s3.philseven.com/public/ecms_stores.csv)

B. Post to our store locator website [https://mapservice.cliqq.net/](https://mapservice.cliqq.net/) A callback URL may be appended to this URL so that the selected store can be returned back to your application.

The following map shows the current store density in Metro Manila so you may want to limit results to be within a 3 kilometer radius.
